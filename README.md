# Rob Hooper Resume Site

This repository contains a responsive, single-page resume website for Rob Hooper. The site is
optimized for GitHub Pages deployment and includes accessible navigation, responsive typography,
print-friendly styles, and dark-mode support.

## Local development

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. All assets are bundled directly in the repository so no
additional tooling or build steps are required.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Commit any updates you make to the repository and push them to GitHub.
2. In GitHub, navigate to **Settings â†’ Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select the branch you want to publish (for a personal site, `main` is typical) and the `/ (root)` folder.
5. Save the settings. GitHub Pages will generate your site and provide a public URL once the deployment finishes.

Updates pushed to the selected branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.
